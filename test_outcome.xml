  <Text category="music">Forget the fact that despite the grumbling
  about today's "music" too many people just swallow and digest the
  slop record companies throw at them, "Hollaback Girl" is the
  absolute DUMBEST "song" I've ever had the displeasure to hear.
  There are two main parts to this travesty: 1. Where she says
  "That's my sh**" no less than a million times, and 2. She
  demonstrates that she's hooked on phonics by being kind enough to
  spell bananas for the rest of us. If this is supposed to be rap,
  Stefani failed miserably. If it's supposed to be dance, again,
  she failed miserably. To be honest, I don't know what the hell
  this is supposed to be because it sure isn't music. The fact that
  it was Number One for so long proves that perhaps people don't
  have any requirements for their ears. - Donna Di Giacom</Text>
  <Text category="health">Printed all over the box are the words "with
  infrared heat". The instructions state that you must add warm
  water to the machine before you start, and the infrared mechanism
  is supposed to maintain the water's warm temperatures. This
  wouldn't be the case. The water cools in a matter of minutes
  after turning the bubbles and massage functions on. Turning on
  the infrared light on top of the machine looks nice, but does
  nothing at all to keep the water warm.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I just finished seeing the movie and loved the
  song at the end and immediately started looking up amazon for
  this song. Thanks to Melania for pointing out the song title at
  the end. I realize this CD is just a soundtrack, but typically
  most soundtracks also include the ending songs. It is just plain
  dumb not to include the best music in this CD. MY VOTE - DO NOT
  BUY THIS CD. The soundtrack is all pretty generic stuff. BUT GET
  THE ENDING TITLE SONG IF YOU CAN - It's great.</Text>
  <Text category="book">A useful book that provides a good summary
  comparing differing Accounting Standards and approaches between
  countries. However, it is not worth the price. It is supposedly
  written for later year undergraduate and masters accounting
  students. It is more suitable for general second year accounting
  students. Plus, as I am working with a multinational European
  bank in Japan, the book is, rapidly becoming, out of date. There
  is none of the simply but incisive commentary which can be found
  in other books about the differences and outcomes of general
  accounting principals drawn from different countries</Text>
  <Text category="music">I felt like I was taking a piss on myself the
  whole time I listened to this album. What happened to the 40
  water of the old days that used to rap with spice 1, 2pac, and mc
  breed? This clone of 40 raps with the likes of Lil jon (wack as
  hell), washed up 80 year old too short, and a bunch of losers I
  have never heard of. The album only gets props because eightball
  and mjg are on the album and ugk. And they almost played
  themselves by appearing on this god awful so called "album". E-40
  has fallen into this commercial west coast version of crunk
  called "hyphy" in attempts to breathe life into his lifeless
  career. The album has some decent beats on it but there is no
  kind of lyrical content to be found anywhere. E-40 wouldn't know
  lyrical content if I slapped him with a Krs-One cd. This cd is
  wack simple and plain, Pee-40 is a beat waster, and he needs to
  find the nearest car wash and start drying off cars!!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We bought this game yesterday for our
  daughter. The dolls are very difficult for her to dress. We have
  to do it for her. Also, two of the dresses have torn already
  after playing the game only about 4 times. She loves the game and
  the princesses, and it does teach memory, but it could be made
  much better.</Text>
