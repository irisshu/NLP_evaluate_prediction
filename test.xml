  <Text category="music">Forget the fact that despite the grumbling
  about today's "music" too many people just swallow and digest the
  this is supposed to be because it sure isn't music. The fact that
  it was Number One for so long proves that perhaps people don't
  have any requirements for their ears. - Donna Di Giacom</Text>
 <Text category="health">I've used the CardioChek 6 times, and had
  my cholesterol checked at a doctor's office during the same
  period. My cholesterol levels according to the doctor's tests are
  always around 200. With the CardioChek they vary by as much as 90
  points. It is a lot of trouble (and expensive) to purchase 3 sets
  of test strips and stab myself 3 times to test total Cholesterol,
  HDL Cholesterol, and Triglycerides. No test strips are included
  in the package when I purchased the CardioChek. The box says
  "includes check strips" but those are something other than test
  strips</Text>
  <Text category="book">This entire book reads like an 8th-Grade
  Research paper. From an uncountable amount of grammatical and
  spelling errors to numerous repeated sentences (literally quotes
  retyped word for word, pages apart), it's difficult not to get
  irritated while reading this. The information on Weezer is great,
  but often times the author veers away from focusing on the band
  and gives too much information on things that even the most
  obsessed fan won't care about. Unfortunately, this appears to be
  the only book on Weezer out right now, so if you want to learn
  more about the band in book form this is all you've got. I
  suggest just browsing around their official website, because it's
  obvious that's where the author got quite a bit of his
  information. Don't waste your money</Text>
